# car Price Prediction Model

I developed a robust car price predictor using Scikit-learn, transforming raw automotive data with Pandas/NumPy into a model that achieved a high $\text{R}^2$ score, making it a valuable tool for buyers and sellers.
From data wrangling to hyperparameter tuning, this project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, leveraging regression models to provide data-driven insights into the dynamics of the used car markets
